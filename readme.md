## Project Purpose

This project is based on the source code from Sergey Kargopolov's "Unit Testing Swift Mobile App" course, with some customizations added.

### Project Goals

The project aims to write unit tests for an iOS mobile application using `XCTest Framework` and gain basic knowledge about `MVP (Model-View-Presenter)` architecture. It focuses on basic testing techniques such as `Mock Dependencies`, `Dependency Injection` principles and `UI Testing`. The project also emphasizes writing code in accordance with SOLID principles and Clean Code standards by following `Test Driven Development (TDD)` methodology.

### Notes

- The MVP architecture has been improved with the latest commit.
- Since the API in Course is no longer accessible, you can create a similar API by running the `app.js` file in the project with the `node app.js` command and make a request to `http://localhost:3001/urlRequest`.
